## Notes
- Idea of abstraction in programming
- Understanding lower levels of abstraction will help in better usage of tools with higher abstraction levels.
- Python compiler converts the python source code to byte code which the interpreter executes (`$ python some_file_name.py`)
- Everything with a value in Python is said to be an object. Every object has a __type__ which is associated with a __class__
    - 42 is integer type and int class
    - True is boolean type and bool class

## Primitives
- Literals - A literal is a syntactic notation that lets you directly represent an object in source code. 

```
'Hello, World' # str literal
3.14           # float literal
True           # bool literal
{'a': 1, 'b': 2} # dict literal
[1, 2, 3]       # list literal
```
